                          Each year, the New York Academy of Sciences selects 1,000 of the worlds brightest high school students (ages 13-17) to become part of The Junior Academy, joining a dynamic global network of like-minded peers and mentors. Students work together on Launchpad, the Academy’s unique, online platform. Launchpad enables students and STEM professionals to collaborate virtually as they compete in project-based challenges focused on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In addition to competing in global challenges, students develop STEM and research experience while advancing vital 21st-century skills such as leadership, communication, and collaboration.<br><br>
                          Junior Academy students work together on challenges in self-selected, international teams of up to 6 members. Each team is paired with a STEM professional who serves as a mentor for the duration of the 10-week challenge period. Our mentors are all highly motivated STEM leaders from academia, industry, and research.<br><br>

                          Created in 1996, the Careers in Science (CiS) Intern Program provides San Francisco youth from communities traditionally underrepresented in STEM (Science Technology Engineering Mathematics) fields with opportunities to immerse themselves in the sciences. Interns develop life and job skills, receive college and career mentorship, and learn science and sustainability concepts in an authentic, paid work environment. CiS provides hands-on science and youth development experiences at the Academy and outdoors while also exposing interns to professional role models and mentors who are leaders in their disciplines. The internship is 2-3 years long.<br><br>

                          Requirements: Students must apply in the 9th or 10th grade, must attend all required events, and must be an SFUSD student.<br><br>

                          High School Explainers, the Exploratorium’s youngest employees, are a diverse group of students who engage visitors at exhibits, lead demonstrations, and run many museum operations. Some are interested in science; all have a spark for learning new things. In keeping with the Exploratorium’s philosophy, they build their own skills while learning to help others.<br><br>
    The High School Explainer Program makes students part of the museum staff, giving them the important responsibility of being the museum’s primary point of contact with visitors. The Explainers learn about exhibits and facilitate visitor-exhibit interactions; open and close the museum; run daily demonstrations (including cow’s eye, heart, and flower dissections); find lost children; evacuate the museum during emergencies; and more.<br><br>
    Three groups of High School Explainers fill over 130 paid positions a year. More than 3,500 students have participated in the program since its inception in 1969, when the Exploratorium first opened.<br><br>
    Explainers are trained in a variety of subjects and are given a lot of responsibility for handling complex interactions and museum operations. Two or three times a week, they meet with science educators, exhibit builders, and other staff. They’re trained in many subjects and are given a lot of responsibility for handling complex interactions and museum operations. The training is focused both on science content and exhibit facilitation. As part of museum operations, Explainers also learn how to effectively respond to visitors’ needs and safety.<br><br>

    Requirements: Students ages 15-18<br><br>

                      Location: Sausalito, CA<br><br>
                      Youth Crew is an annual service-learning program at The Marine Mammal Center for high school aged students in the greater Bay Area. To participate in the program teens, apply online and interview in the fall, selected applicants are inducted into the program in January. The program commitment runs from January through August, in which a youth volunteer accumulates on average 120 hours of volunteer service in animal care and education.<br><br>
Youth Crew volunteers first receive training to join an animal care crew during the Center’s busy season from January through May. During this time Youth Crew volunteers will assist and participate in animal husbandry tasks such as washing equipment, sorting fish, cleaning animal pens/pools, weighing animals, scribing observations, managing animals in pens and more as training permits. From June through August Youth Crew volunteers receive training to become youth counselors or youth interpreters for education programs at The Marine Mammal Center. Education volunteers may support our camp experiences for elementary students, or engage our visiting public on ocean conservation issues such as marine debris and climate change. The combined volunteer experiences will see participants through the work of rehabilitating marine mammals, engaging guests, and inspiring the next generation of ocean stewards. <br><br>
Throughout the program, we apply best practices in service-learning to support the development of every program participant toward their full potential. Youth Crew participants who gain the most form the program are present for all scheduled shifts, attend trainings, participate in workshops, access unique learning resources, and reflect on their volunteer experience. <br><br>
